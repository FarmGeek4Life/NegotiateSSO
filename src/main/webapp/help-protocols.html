    Which authentication protocols to use, and in which order.<br />
    Negotiate prefers Kerberos and will use it unless it is unavailable; it then will use NTLM.<br />
    Kerberos will always be unavailable if the system is not connected to a domain, or is configured incorrectly.<br />
    NTLM is an additional option that will allow setting a preference for NTLM, <br />
    or to prevent errors in case of Kerberos misconfiguration.<br />
